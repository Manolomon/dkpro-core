description: |
  GUM is an open source multilayer corpus of richly annotated web texts from eight text types. 
  The corpus is collected and expanded by students as part of the curriculum in LING-367 
  Computational Corpus Linguistics at Georgetown University. The selection of text types is meant 
  to represent different communicative purposes, while coming from sources that are readily and 
  openly available (mostly Creative Commons licenses), so that new texts can be annotated and 
  published with ease.

  The CPOS column of the files contains an extended POS tagset as it is used by the English 
  TreeTagger models. The POS column contains the regular PTB tagset.
