How do existing and anticipated standards work?
Standards can be valuable in promoting food safety, but the process by which they are set, and the speed at which they are implemented, may result in exclusion of vulnerable groups.
Standards and regulations for animal health, food safety and food quality affect and are affected by the structure of livestock food chains.
It is possible for participants in livestock value chains to comply with changes in standards.
